# Order Book Simulator

A high-performance, multi-threaded **order book simulator** written in C++ that models real-time trading. This program generates random buy and sell orders, processes them against an order book, and executes trades automatically when prices match.

## Features

- **Random order generation**  
  Multiple threads generate BUY and SELL orders with random prices, quantities, and types:  
  - **LIMIT**: added to the order book if unmatched  
  - **MARKET**: executes immediately at the best available price  
  - **IOC (Immediate or Cancel)**: executes immediately, remaining unmatched quantity is canceled  

- **Multi-threaded order generation**  
  Simulates many traders submitting orders concurrently.  

- **Thread-safe order queue**  
  Orders are pushed into a `TSQueue` for safe processing by the main thread.  

- **Automatic trade execution**  
  Orders are matched according to price and time priority:  
  - BUY orders match the lowest available SELL orders  
  - SELL orders match the highest available BUY orders  
  - Trades record buyer ID, seller ID, price, quantity, and timestamp  

- **Order book maintenance**  
  Keeps track of bids (descending) and asks (ascending).  
  Prints top N levels of the order book after processing.
